# High priority
Stuff that I absolutely need to add to make it go from barebones to fleshed out. 
- Add local storage of input data
- Add a menu; Either to each element or on the right side when you select an element
- Ensure readability of the website

# Medium priority
Stuff that I could add, but isn't necessarily essential.
- Create a more dynamic, aestethicly pleasing experience


# Low Priority
Other cool stuff that I might come up with will go here.
- Star fall or rain animation
- Toggle different hues for the background with a few buttons. Alternatively being able to pick these colors if I'm REALLY bored.
